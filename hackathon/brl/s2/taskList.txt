current problems with adaptive window:
1. tile location (in ROI map and in .tc file) is incorrect relative to the image data.
2. the image data is (probably) what you want (i.e the continuing dendrite in a neighboring area), but the location
is incorrect.

to be clear: the final stitched data does not accurately show continuous structures because the image tiles are placed at the
wrong location. as opposed to placing the tiles at the right location with the wrong image data


so the tile location between the internal stuff (location.x location.y ,etc) and the scan location
needs to be figured out.  maybe shifting the coordinates by half the window is not enough?  also need a global origin shift?

ugh.  adaptive window scanning is broken. somehow invalid zooms are being passed to PV.  also PV is not starting the zstack for some reason.

URGENT:  FIX EVENTLOGGER!   time differences are inconsistent, whole file gets appended multiple times, some negative elapsed times, add summary statistics

 Add tab for configuration info,
add option to run 1 marker or run all markers
Add ROI controls-  with z scan info.
Add total info /progress into dialog at ‘click ok’ and maybe add cancel option.
add mode for resonant control. most code is now robust against active mode, but need a button to set active mode
and ideally a way to assess if it's running properly at the tight zoom

2016.02.11  update task list

NEW:
1. add mode for resonant control. most code is now robust against active mode, but need a button to set active mode
and ideally a way to assess if it's running properly at the tight zoom

2. Add tab for configuration info, including button to update save directory. also add code to check for existance of .config save directory

REMAINING FROM PREVIOUS:
add option to run 1 marker or run all markers
Add total info /progress into dialog at ‘click ok’ and maybe add cancel option.
#Try MIP display for each ROI,
Add ROI controls-  with z scan info.
#allow user to generate block grid based on 2 anchor points in preview scan
#...then Automatically scan the whole grid in full resolution.


2015.02.01 meeting generated this chunk of tasks:

# add RESET button to return system (to overview mode?)
#add preview with 3-5 plane MIP
#add cell body markers as starting locations
add option to run 1 marker or run all markers
#add option to pop up window for tracing or not
# add configuration.

GUI:

# Move ROI monitor field to another tab on left side. Keep right side devoted to ROI overview graphicsview.



# NoteTaker- make ‘save’ functional,  ALSO ADDED LOCAL SAVE DIRECTORY FOR ALL RELEVANT STACK, SWC, v3draw, etc data

# hook up all qDebug<< and s2LineEdit to status.

# Eliminate display of file reads.

# CLEANED UP stack loading code to eliminate duplicate code. need to test

# add automatic saving of notes file.


# Make “smartScan”  the biggest, first button so the user can see what to do.

# Improve wording on buttons/labels



#Add dialog for ‘entire thing finished’ or similar..






# but it’s more important to display order number on ROI plot.



# Fix ROI xy directions on ROI plot relative to images



# didnt do this- just look for the highest numberDisplay current ROI location in red and/or label ‘current’.



Internal control of the program:


# Add user-adjustable overlap between tiles.





Major Addition:

# testing single plane version>Create method to scan whole area in low-res preview mode with no z (or 3 plane z stack MIP?)  and show the image.

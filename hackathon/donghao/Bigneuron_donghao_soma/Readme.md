#SomaDetect V3D Plugin developed at RivuletStudio@Uni.Sydney, Australia

The algorithm was developed based on the Rivulet2 algorithm developed by Donghao Zhang and Siqi Liu. This development and the evaluation of this algorithm was highly supported by the BigNeuron project.

You can also find the Python package at https://github.com/lsqshr/rivuletpy with Rivulet2 implemented.

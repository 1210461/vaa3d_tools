==to build==
1. copy all the files and folders from here to corresponding places in vaa3d_external project.
2. add the files into the VS project if they are not in it yet.
3. configure the VS project as shown in the screenshots.
4. build and run.

==to run directly==
Alternatively, it's likely that you can directly run the provided exe file without building the project.

==known issues==
don't move the mouse after entering vr mode, otherwise it's likely to crash. I think I know the root cause to this issue, haven't got time to fix it though.

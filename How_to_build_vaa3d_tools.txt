To build vaa3d_tool plugins, the best way is to check out the Vaa3D code as following:

git clone https://github.com/Vaa3D/v3d_external.git
git clone https://github.com/Vaa3D/vaa3d_tools.git
cd vaa3d_tools
ln -s ../v3d_external/v3d_main v3d_main
ln -s ../v3d_external/bin bin
cd ../v3d_external
ln -s ../vaa3d_tools/released_plugins released_plugins_more
build.macx -B -m -j4
# or running the alterative for Linux
# build.linux -B -j4

The last few lines create symbolic links for necessary header files and output plugins.

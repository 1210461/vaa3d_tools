The ConsensusBuilder takes a set of SWC neuron reconstruction files (currently
only as a directory of such files), aligns them into a single composite, and
then extracts a consensus given several parameters. It is expected that all 
reconstructions are scaled equivalently and are resampled at the same 
frequency. The Bash script detailed below the parameter list can be used to 
call the Vaa3D resample code and run the ConsensusBuilder.

Additional parameters exist within the algorithm but are not currently 
accessible to the command line.

Since multiple branches may turn out to be potential matches (with a 
sufficiently good scoring alignment), there can be match conflicts. Those 
conflicts may overlap, creating a sort of web of conflicts. All possible sets
of branch matches are considered to determine the best set. The number of sets
grows exponentially with the number of branches in the conflict web. Thus,
with poorly tuned parameters and certain reconstructions, the memory and
computational complexity grows exponentially and can eat up your system's
resources. While heuristics for dealing with this problem are being considered, 
for now it would be best to monitor runs to avoid crashing your system. See 
after the parameter listing for details of a Bash script which handles this.

Assuming such out of control cases do not occur, and depending on the 
complexity of the reconstructions (i.e. number of nodes and branches), your 
runtime should be on the order of seconds to minutes.

./consensusbuilder -d <swc_directory> -o <output_file> -c <confidence proportion>

Required parameters:

-d|--directory		Directory of swc files to include in the consensus

-o|--output			Output file, either an swc or eswc file

-c|--confidence		Branch confidence is given by the number of reconstructions
					that have a branch matched to a given branch in the 
					composite. A composite branch is included in the consensus
					if its confidence is greater than the value of this 
					parameter. (In the future, multiple values will be 
					accepted for multiple consensus outputs for the same
					composite.)

Optional parameters:

-s|--scale			The pixel-to-micron ratio of the x and y axes. [1]

-z|--z-scale		The pixel-to-micron ratio of the z axis. [1]

-l|--log-level		Numbers 0 through 7 specifying how detailed the log output 
					should be. [0]
						0	Error
						1 	Warning
						2	Info
						3	Debug
						4-7	Debug1-Debug4

-e|--euclidean 		Euclidean distance threshold used in branch sequence 
					alignment. At this distance a pair of nodes will have a
					score of 0. [3.0]

-a|--angle 			The angle between node vectors, in radians, at which the  
					alignment score of a node pair is 0. [PI/4]

-r|--rescue			Specifies a confidence value, less than or equal to the
					'confidence' parameter, which enables a branch to be
					included if no other branches are available to be
					an above threshold branch's parent. [0]

--single-tree		A flag which restricts the consensus to a single tree
					rooted by the root branch with the greatest connection
					confidence.

The ConsensusScript.sh Bash script may provide a good starting point for your 
own script. It's core capability is to run the Vaa3D resample code on all 
reconstructions in the source directory. The resampled files will go in a 
different 'target' directory. Gold standard files, identified by their '00' 
prefix, are resampled and placed in a 'goldstandard' subdirectory to the 
target. If your gold standard files are labeled in some other manner, you will 
need to change the value of the GS_REGEX variable to reflect that. This of 
course all requires Vaa3D to be installed. The first two variables of the 
script set the directories of thc ConsensusBuilder and Vaa3D.

The script also deletes files that are too large relative to the gold standard 
(code starting at line 151). Specifically, if the gold standard exists and a 
resampled reconstruction's node count is more than four times the resampled 
gold standard, then the resampled and original reconstructions are deleted. 
The ratio is three times if the number of nodes in the resampled file is 
greater than 2500 (line 164).

The script also monitors the memory usage of the ConsensusBuilder. If the
memory usage goes above a set value, the program will be terminated. The 
value is set in the MB_SIZE_LIMIT variable, which currently is set to
12GB (12*1024MB).

./ConsensusScript.sh -s <source_dir> -t <target_dir>

Parameters:

-s|--source-dir		The directory of the source swc files.

-t|--target-dir		The directory to which the resampled swc files are 
					written.

-o|--output-swc		The output file of the consensusbuilder program. 
					[<target-dir>/consensus/<source-dir base>.swc]

--scale 			Scale parameter passed into consensusbuilder. The 
					resample rate is set to 1.2 times this scale parameter. 
					(see RESAMPLE_RATE variable) [1]

-d|--debug 			Passed into consensusbuilder as the log-level parameter. 
					[1]

-e|--euclidean 		Passed into consensusbuilder as the euclidean parameter.
					[3.0]

-a|--angle 			Passed into consensusbuilder as the angle parameter. [PI/4]

-f|--force			Flag that causes files to be resampled regardless of 
					whether they have been resampled previously.
